### Built with

Flexbox
JavaScript

### What I learned

This project has been very helpful in making me understand how the undo and redo functionality of many programs work when using the stack data structure. I think it is really neat to be able to visually show how the undo and redo stacks work in tandem with the text editor to enable the undo and redo functionality to the user.
